# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
Created the back end for an E-Commerce site by taking a functional Express API and using the Sequelize ORM library to interact with a MYSQL database. 

## Tasks Completed 
* Configured the Sequelize ORM in a Node.js application.
* Created models for categories, products, and tags in a relational database and a through table that will connect the product and tag models. 
* Defined and implemented CRUD methods, using Sequelize to interact with your models in each API endpoint through proper RESTful commands (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* Created and implemented Sequelize associations to join tables. 
* Used environment variables to protect sensitive data, such as your MYSQL username and password.
